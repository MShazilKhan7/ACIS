## Machine Learning Curriculum Enhancement Plan - Fall 2025

This plan outlines actionable improvements to the "Machine Learning" undergraduate course, addressing student feedback, performance data, and current industry trends.

### 1️⃣ Detailed Curriculum Improvements

1.  **MLOps and Model Deployment Module:**
    *   **Description:** Introduce a dedicated module covering the end-to-end Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) lifecycle. This includes model versioning, containerization (Docker), deployment strategies (Kubernetes, cloud platforms like AWS SageMaker or Azure ML), monitoring, and automated retraining pipelines.
    *   **Rationale:** Addresses the industry need for practical deployment skills and the lack of hands-on experience highlighted in student feedback.
    *   **Activities:** Hands-on labs deploying a simple model to a cloud platform, creating a CI/CD pipeline for model updates, and monitoring model performance in a simulated production environment.

2.  **Data Engineering and Feature Engineering Enhancement:**
    *   **Description:** Expand the curriculum to include more in-depth coverage of data acquisition, cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering techniques. Focus on using SQL for data manipulation and introduce basic concepts of big data processing using Python with libraries like Pandas and Spark.
    *   **Rationale:** Addresses the need for stronger data handling skills, as identified in the industry trend analysis and the strong correlation between GPA and course performance (suggesting foundational knowledge gaps).
    *   **Activities:** A project involving cleaning and preparing a real-world dataset (e.g., from Kaggle) for machine learning, using SQL to extract relevant features, and applying feature selection techniques.

3.  **Advanced Evaluation Metrics and Model Interpretability:**
    *   **Description:** Go beyond basic accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Introduce advanced metrics like AUC-ROC, precision-recall curves, and techniques for model interpretability (e.g., SHAP values, LIME).
    *   **Rationale:** Provides a more nuanced understanding of model performance and addresses the need for responsible AI development.
    *   **Activities:** A lab session analyzing the performance of different models using various evaluation metrics and interpreting model predictions using SHAP values.

4.  **Ethical Considerations and Bias Mitigation in ML:**
    *   **Description:** Introduce a new section dedicated to the ethical implications of machine learning, including bias detection and mitigation techniques. Cover topics like fairness, accountability, and transparency in AI.
    *   **Rationale:** Addresses the growing importance of ethical considerations in AI development and ensures students are aware of potential biases in data and algorithms.
    *   **Activities:** A case study analyzing a real-world example of biased AI and developing strategies to mitigate the bias.

### 2️⃣ Missing Modern Skills and Industry-Relevant Modules

*   **Missing Skills:** Kubernetes, Docker, SQL (beyond basic usage), Linux command-line, Git (for version control and collaboration), Scala (for big data processing).
*   **Missing Modules:** MLOps, Data Engineering for Machine Learning, Model Interpretability, Ethical AI.

### 3️⃣ Recommended Case Studies, Hands-On Labs, and Emerging Technologies

*   **Case Studies:**
    *   **Fraud Detection:** Analyzing credit card transaction data to detect fraudulent activity.
    *   **Customer Churn Prediction:** Predicting which customers are likely to cancel their subscriptions.
    *   **Medical Image Analysis:** Using deep learning to detect diseases in medical images.
*   **Hands-On Labs:**
    *   **Deploying a model using Docker and Kubernetes.**
    *   **Building a data pipeline using SQL and Pandas.**
    *   **Implementing a bias detection and mitigation algorithm.**
*   **Emerging Technologies:**
    *   **Explainable AI (XAI):** Techniques for making machine learning models more transparent and understandable.
    *   **Federated Learning:** Training models on decentralized data without sharing the data itself.
    *   **Generative AI:** Exploring the use of generative models for data augmentation and creative applications.

### 4️⃣ Executive Summary for Educators

Student feedback highlights the need for more practical application and less repetitive content. Performance data indicates a strong correlation between GPA and course success, suggesting foundational knowledge gaps. Industry trends demand MLOps and data engineering skills. Integrate practical labs, streamline content, and introduce MLOps, advanced evaluation metrics, and ethical considerations to enhance student engagement and employability.
